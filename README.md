# Canny Edge Detectio

This project demonstrates the Canny Edge Detection algorithm—a popular edge detection technique in image processing. The code processes the input image (animal-fox.webp) and detects edges using the Canny method in Python.

## Features
- Implements Canny Edge Detection
- Works with sample image animal-fox.webp
- Jupyter Notebook interface (main.ipynb)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

### Install Requirements
If using pip, you can install the dependencies via:
bash
pip install opencv-python numpy jupyter


## Usage
1. Make sure you have all requirements installed.
2. Place your input image (e.g., animal-fox.webp) in the project folder.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   
4. Follow the instructions in main.ipynb to run the edge detection.

## Credits
This project was developed for learning and demonstration purposes.
